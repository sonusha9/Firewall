# Firewall
 GUI-based firewalls


A firewall is a network security system, available as hardware or software, that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet), protecting against unauthorized access, malware, and cyberattacks. 
Key Functions and Benefits
Packet Filtering: Inspects data packets to decide whether to allow (accept) or block (drop/reject) them.
Access Control: Restricts unauthorized users from accessing private networks.
Traffic Monitoring: Regulates both inbound and outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration.
Security Segmentation: Can isolate network segments to limit the spread of potential threats. 
Types of Firewalls
Packet-Filtering Firewalls: Basic,, rule-based filtering (e.g., IP address, port).
Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Monitors the context of active connections to allow only legitimate, initiated traffic.
Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): Advanced, combining traditional filtering with application awareness, threat intelligence, and encrypted traffic inspection.
Proxy Firewalls: Acts as an intermediary, masking the internal network from the internet.
Host-Based Firewalls: Software installed on individual devices for localized protection. 
Firewalls are essential for securing networks by enforcing policies, such as blocking specific websites, preventing unauthorized access, or managing network bandwidth.
